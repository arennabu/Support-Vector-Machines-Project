# Support-Vector-Machines-Project

### Introduction
In machine learning, suppert vector machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.

For this project, the famous [Iris flower data set] will be used(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
